OpenFDM
-------

OpenFDM is a flightmodel for realtime or for standalone scriptable use.
It has grown out of the desire to have a professional aerodynamic flightmodel
with properly modeled ground reactions. Starting from that it became clear
that existing code is not fixable without major modifications.
Thus I started a new project of a flightmodel with the following Features:

- Table driven aerodynamics.
- Accurate and stable timestepping.
- Multibody system for mechanical components.
- Up to date friction/tire models.
- Crash detection with load limits for particular parts.
- Flight control system.
- Reads old and new JSBSim configs files.
