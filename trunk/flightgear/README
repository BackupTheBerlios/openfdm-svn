This directory contains the files required to integrate OpenFDM
into flightgear.

To do this, build and install the OpenFDM package into the same
prefix than SimGear is built into.

Create a new directory in flightgears source directory:
  source/src/FDM/OpenFDM

Then copy the files from this directory into the newly created
one.

Apply the patch 'flightgear.diff' to the source directory. This
one will integrate this new directory into the build system and
it will call the initialization routines if we find a OpenFDM
aircraft.

Reconfigure and rebuild flightgear.

Have fun.
